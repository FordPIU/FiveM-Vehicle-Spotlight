# FiveM Vehicle Spotlight
 
This is a repository for a FiveM script that enhances the lighting on vehicles in the game. The script takes the existing spotlight bones rotation in the game and adds an extra layer of light to make it brighter. By doing so, the script ensures that the light and the spotlight on the vehicle are perfectly in sync.

In other words, the script improves the realism and accuracy of the lighting in the game by ensuring that the lighting effects follow the movement of the spotlight on the vehicle.

The RGB values for the light are customizable, meaning that users can adjust the color of the light to their liking. This allows for greater customization and personalization of the game's lighting effects.

Overall, this script is a useful tool for those looking to enhance the visual realism of their FiveM gaming experience. Super easy to install.
